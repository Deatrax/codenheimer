## Installation

### üîπ **Using Prebuilt Installers (Recommended)**
The easiest way to install Codenheimer is by downloading the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Deatrax/codenheimer/releases) page. These installers contain all required dependencies, so no additional setup is needed.

1. Download the latest version for your platform.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Now we are still students and do not have the means to buy a code-signing certificate. So please ignore the warning given by windows when the installer is run. Just Select the **"More info"** option.   - Then, click on **"Run anyway"** to proceed with the installation.
3. Launch Codenheimer and start coding!

### üîπ **Building from Source**
If you prefer to build Codenheimer yourself, follow these steps:

#### **Prerequisites**
- Qt (at least Qt 6.x)
- OpenSSL (bundled with the source code, so no manual installation is needed)

#### **Steps to Build**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Deatrax/codenheimer.git
   cd Codenheimer
   ```
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or build via terminal:
   ```sh
   qmake Codenheimer.pro
   make  # or mingw32-make on Windows
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   ./Codenheimer
   ```
